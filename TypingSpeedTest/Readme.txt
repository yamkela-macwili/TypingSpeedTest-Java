    Program Description:

The "Typing Speed Test" program is a graphical user interface (GUI) application implemented in Java. It allows users to test and measure their typing speed by typing a given text within a certain time frame. The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can start and end the typing test, and it displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) upon completion.

Features:
1. GUI Interface: The program utilizes Swing, a Java GUI toolkit, to create an interactive and visually appealing interface for the typing speed test.

2. Start and End Buttons: The program includes a "Start" button to initiate the typing test and an "End" button to conclude the test and display the results.

3. Text Display: The program displays the given text that users need to type in a text area. The text is randomly selected from a predefined set of options, offering variety for each test.

4. Timer: The program measures the time elapsed from the start of the test until the user finishes typing. It calculates the typing speed based on the time taken and the number of words typed.

5. Typing Speed Calculation: The program calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) by dividing the number of words typed by the time taken and multiplying by 60.

6. Result Display: Upon completing the test, the program presents the user's typing speed as a message dialog, showing the WPM value with two decimal places.

Usage:
1. Launch the "Typing Speed Test" program.
2. Click the "Start" button to begin the typing test.
3. Type the displayed text accurately in the provided text area.
4. Once finished, press the "End" button.
5. A message dialog will appear, showing the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM).
6. To take another test, click the "Start" button again.

Note: The program verifies if the typed text matches the given text. If they don't match, an error message is displayed, indicating the need to retype the text accurately.

The "Typing Speed Test" program is designed to help users assess and improve their typing skills. It provides a simple and interactive way to measure and track their progress over time.

# Typing Speed Test

The "Typing Speed Test" is a Java-based application that allows users to measure their typing speed by typing a given text within a specified time frame. It provides an interactive and user-friendly GUI interface for conducting typing tests and calculating the typing speed in words per minute (WPM).

## Features

- Start and End Buttons: Initiate and conclude the typing test.
- Randomly Generated Text: The program selects a random text from a predefined set of options for each test.
- Timer: Measures the time elapsed from the start to the end of the test.
- Typing Speed Calculation: Calculates the typing speed in WPM based on the time taken and the number of words typed.
- Result Display: Presents the typing speed as a message dialog upon test completion.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
3. Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
   ```
   javac typingspeedtest/*.java
   ```
4. Run the program.
   ```
   java typingspeedtest.TypingSpeedTestApp
   ```
5. Click the "Start" button to begin the typing test.
6. Type the displayed text accurately in the text field.
7. Press the "Enter" key or click the "End" button to complete the test.
8. A message dialog will appear, displaying your typing speed in WPM.
9. Click the "Start" button again to take another test.
